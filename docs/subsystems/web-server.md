# HTTP Server

English | [中文](web-server.zh.md)

[dsh-host-webserver](../../packages/host/webserver) is the browser HTTP carrier for the GUI host: a single `node:http` plugin providing `ctx.webServer`, a named-route registry, index.html transform callbacks, and one fallback handler that a plugin may claim. It is not part of the agent loop and not a capability seam; it knows no harness concepts, and another plugin registers every feature route, including the `/api` bridge, plugin bundles, and the HMR event stream ([layering note](../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-19-gui-layering-and-rpc-protocol.md)). It serves browsers only: Electron loads the built files over `file://` and sends fetch requests through an IPC bridge instead of this server.

## Routes

```ts type-equiv
/** Route match kind: 'exact' matches the pathname verbatim; 'prefix' p matches p and p/<anything>. */
type WebRouteKind = 'exact' | 'prefix'
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One named route registration. */
interface WebRoute {
  kind: WebRouteKind
  /** Absolute pathname, no trailing slash. */
  path: string
  /** Owns the full response lifecycle (may hold the response open, e.g. SSE). */
  handler: (req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse) => void | Promise<void>
}
```

Match order is fixed: exact table first, then longest matching prefix, then the registered fallback. Registration order carries no request-facing semantics — named routes are composed to be disjoint, and the fallback seat answers anything no named route claims; one owner only, a second registration throws. The shipped Web composition claims the seat with [`dsh-host-frontend-static`](../../packages/host/frontend-static/src/index.ts), the SPA dist server with locked semantics: non-GET/HEAD is 405, traversal outside the dist root is 403, a readable index renders at the dist root and configured index path, existing files are served directly, absent or non-file targets are empty 404 responses, and unknown extensions ship as octet-stream.

## Config

```ts type-equiv
/** Gateway config: the listen address. */
interface Config {
  /** Listen host; the two supported values are loopback and all-interfaces. */
  host: '127.0.0.1' | '0.0.0.0'
  /** Listen port; zero requests an OS-assigned port. */
  port: number
}
```

`host` accepts only `127.0.0.1` (default posture) and `0.0.0.0` (deliberate network exposure); there is no TLS, auth, or origin policy, so a non-loopback bind exposes the server to that network. The dist location is an assembly fact of the frontend plugin that claims the seat.

## The service

`WebServer` (`ctx.webServer`) listens immediately on activation; a listen failure (EADDRINUSE…) rejects initialization, and the boot process reports the failed fiber. `register(route)` adds one named route and returns its disposer; a duplicate `(kind, path)` throws because route patterns are a composition-level contract and a collision is a misconfiguration. `collectIndexInjections()` gathers structured `IndexInjection` rows over one `webserver/index-inject` emit, and `renderIndex(html)` renders them into successful root and configured index responses before applying the raw `tapIndex(transform)` escape-hatch transforms in registration order; [dsh-client-modules](../../packages/client/modules) answers the event with the boot manifest rows. `port` reads the listening port, including the port assigned by the OS when `config.port` is 0.

A request whose handling throws (a malformed %-escape hitting `decodeURIComponent`, a client dropping mid-body) is logged as a warning and answered 400 — or the socket destroyed when headers are already out — never a process exit. Disposal pairs `close()` with `closeAllConnections()` because a handler may hold its response open (SSE) and such connections never end on their own; without the force-close, teardown would hang. The package never prints: the URL line belongs to the shell. Per-package operational detail, including the dev-mode bundle watch pipeline, stays in the [README](../../packages/host/webserver/README.md).

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.webServer` — `WebServer`

The browser HTTP carrier service. Activation listens immediately. Route registration order does not affect requests because configured named routes must be distinct, and the fallback handler answers anything not yet claimed during startup with 404 until its owner registers. A listen failure rejects initialization, and the boot process reports the failed fiber.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register a named route. Duplicate (kind, path) throws — route patterns are
 * a composition-level contract, so a collision is a misconfiguration.
 * @param route - kind, path, and the owning handler.
 * @returns the disposer removing the route.
 */
register(route: WebRoute): () => void

/**
 * Register an exact-path HTTP upgrade route. Duplicate paths throw because
 * one socket can have only one protocol owner.
 * @param route - pathname and handler owning negotiation plus socket use.
 * @returns the disposer removing the route.
 */
registerUpgrade(route: WebUpgradeRoute): () => void

/**
 * Claim the fallback seat: the handler answering every request no named
 * route matches (the SPA dist server in the shipped Web composition). One
 * owner only — a second registration throws, because two fallbacks cannot
 * compose.
 * @param handler - owns the full response lifecycle of unmatched requests.
 * @returns the disposer releasing the seat.
 */
registerFallback(handler: WebRoute['handler']): () => void

/**
 * Register the request gate: the one pre-dispatch hook every HTTP request
 * and WebSocket upgrade passes before route matching. The gate returns
 * `true` to admit the request, or `false` to reject it — for HTTP the gate
 * owns the rejection response when it returns false (redirect / 401 / login
 * page); for upgrades the server answers 403 and destroys the socket. One
 * gate only; a second registration throws. (Local fork: deployment
 * authentication hook.)
 * @param check - `(req, res, pathname) => boolean | Promise<boolean>`; `res` is `null` for upgrades.
 * @returns the disposer removing the gate.
 */
registerGate(check: WebRequestGate): () => void

/**
 * Register a raw-HTML index transform, the escape hatch for markup no
 * {@link IndexInjection} row expresses: {@link renderIndex} applies taps in
 * registration order after rendering the structured rows.
 * @param transform - pure html-to-html function.
 * @returns the disposer removing the transform.
 */
tapIndex(transform: (html: string) => string): () => void

/**
 * Run an index.html body through the registered taps in registration order
 * — called by the fallback owner on every index response it renders.
 * @param html - the raw index.html body.
 * @returns the transformed body.
 */
applyIndexTaps(html: string): string

/**
 * Gather the structured injection table: one `webserver/index-inject` emit,
 * every subscriber pushes its current rows. Fresh per call, so subscribers
 * read live state (module graph, theme preference) at emit time.
 * @returns rows in subscriber activation order.
 */
collectIndexInjections(): IndexInjection[]

/**
 * Render one index.html body: the structured injection table first, then
 * the raw `tapIndex` transforms over the result.
 * @param html - the raw index.html body.
 * @returns the transformed body.
 */
renderIndex(html: string): string

#### `webserver/index-inject` — emit

Collect the structured index injection table. Emitted on every index render and every worker boot-payload request; listeners push their current rows, so a row's data is read fresh at emit time.
