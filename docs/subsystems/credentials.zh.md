# 用户凭据

[English](credentials.md) | 中文

[dsh-credentials](../../packages/credentials/credentials) 的凭据 seam 把机密挡在配置之外：settings 分节与 `cordis.yml` 条目携带的是*引用*（环境变量名），值归 [dsh-credentials-local](../../packages/credentials/credentials-local) 这类提供方所有，消费方每个操作解析一次引用——LLM（大语言模型）适配器每次模型请求解析一次，因此轮换后的凭据无需任何重启即可作用于紧随其后的下一次请求。一条 seam 级规则约束每个提供方：空的存储值在任何地方都视为不存在。

来源：[`packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts`](../../packages/credentials/credentials/src/index.ts)

## 标识

引用以 POSIX 风格环境变量名命名一条凭据。brand 防止调用方将凭据引用与在包或进程之间传递的其他字符串混用；构造时校验 shell 标识符语法。

```ts type-equiv
/** Nominal reference to one credential: a POSIX-style environment-variable name. */
type CredentialRef = Branded<'CredentialRef'>
```

## 解析

`resolve(ref)` 返回值及提供该值的来源层（由提供方定义）；未配置期间返回 `undefined`。消费方在每个操作中重新解析，绝不跨操作缓存——这种按操作进行的读取正是热更新机制。

```ts type-equiv
/** One resolved credential value and the source layer that supplied it. */
interface ResolvedCredential {
  /** The non-empty secret value. */
  value: string
  /** Provider-defined source layer id (the local provider uses `env`, `file`, `project-env`, and `user-env`). */
  source: string
}
```

## 描述

`describe(ref)` 在绝不暴露值的前提下回应配置界面：引用当前是否可解析、来自哪一层、`set` 当前能否成功。本地提供方把由当前进程环境供值的引用报告为 `writable: false`——那样的写入会表面成功而解析持续返回遮蔽值，因此 seam 直接拒绝，界面也得以提前把该引用渲染为只读。

```ts type-equiv
/** Source and writability facts for one reference, safe for configuration UIs — never the value. */
interface CredentialInfo {
  /** Whether {@link CredentialProvider.resolve} would currently return a value. */
  configured: boolean
  /** Source layer currently supplying the value; absent while unconfigured. */
  source?: string
  /** Whether {@link CredentialProvider.set} would currently succeed for this reference. */
  writable: boolean
}
```

## 已提交的变更

`credentials/reference-updated (ref)` 在提供方管理的来源发生已提交变更后发出——`set`、`unset` 或在存储中观察到的外部编辑。进程环境自身的变化不可观测，永不发出事件。消费方不需要该事件（它们按操作重新解析）；它服务于配置界面刷新「已配置」徽标。

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.zh.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.authorization` — `AuthorizationService`

`ctx.authorization`: a registry of credential-obtaining flows, one attempt at a time per key.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Offer a way to obtain one credential. One flow per key: two plugins
 * claiming the same key would each write a record in their own format, and
 * whichever ran last would leave the other reading a payload it cannot parse.
 *
 * @param flow - the key it writes, its label, its methods, and its runner.
 * @returns Disposer that withdraws this flow.
 * @throws {AuthorizationError} code `DUPLICATE_FLOW` when the key is already claimed.
 */
registerFlow(flow: AuthorizationFlow): () => void

/**
 * Every registered flow, for a surface listing what can be authorized.
 * @returns one entry per flow, in registration order.
 */

 * @param key - the credential record to ask about.
 * @returns the entry, or undefined when no flow claims that key.
 */

/**
 * Withdraw the attempt running for a key, if any. Separate from the
 * request's own signal because a request/response transport answers a Cancel
 * button on a second call, with no handle on the first one's signal.
 * @param key - the credential record whose attempt should stop.
 */
cancel(key: CredentialKey): void

/**
 * Run one attempt to authorize a key, and report how it ended.
 *
 * One attempt per key at a time. A second caller is refused rather than

 *
 * @param request - the key, the method, the surface, and the cancel signal.
 * @returns `authorized` once the flow's record is committed during this

 *   `UNKNOWN_METHOD` when the named method is not one the flow offers,
 *   `ALREADY_IN_FLIGHT` when an attempt is already running for the key, or

### `ctx.credentials` — `CredentialProvider` (abstract seam)

Abstract credential service over two key spaces that answer two questions.

A CredentialRef answers "what is behind this environment-variable name", layered over the process environment, the provider-managed store, and `.env` files. One seam-wide rule binds that half: an empty stored value is absent everywhere — `resolve` skips it, `describe` reports it unconfigured — so a blank never masquerades as a configured secret.

A CredentialKey answers "what credential does this plugin hold for this id". Nothing can layer here — an authorization grant has no environment to be read from — so presence of the record is the whole fact, and modifyRecord is the only write path because a correct write depends on the current value (a token refresh is read-decide-replace under one lock).

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Resolve one reference to its current value. Resolution is per call:
 * consumers re-resolve at each operation and must not cache across
 * operations — that per-operation read is what makes a changed credential
 * reach the next operation without a restart.
 * @param ref - the reference to resolve.
 * @returns the value and its source, or `undefined` while unconfigured.
 */
abstract resolve(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<ResolvedCredential | undefined>

/**
 * Describe one reference for configuration surfaces without exposing the
 * value.
 * @param ref - the reference to describe.
 * @returns configured state, supplying source, and writability.
 */
abstract describe(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<CredentialInfo>

/**
 * Durably store one value in the provider-managed writable source. Rejects
 * while a read-only source shadows the reference — the write would appear
 * to succeed while resolution keeps returning the shadowing value — and
 * rejects an empty value (use {@link unset}).
 * @param ref - the reference to store.
 * @param value - the non-empty secret value.
 */
abstract set(ref: CredentialRef, value: string): Promise<void>

/**
 * Remove one reference from the provider-managed writable source; removing
 * an absent reference is a no-op. Rejects while a read-only source shadows
 * the reference, like {@link set}.
 * @param ref - the reference to remove.
 */
abstract unset(ref: CredentialRef): Promise<void>

/**
 * Read one stored record. The value is returned as its owner wrote it; a
 * {@link GrantRecord} payload is not interpreted on the way out.
 * @param key - the record to read.
 * @returns the record, or `undefined` while none is stored.

/**

 * half, which has no enumeration because configuration surfaces learn which
 * references exist from settings schemas, records have no such discovery
 * path: a surface that cannot list them cannot show what a user is
 * authorized for, nor find an orphan left by an uninstalled plugin.
 * @returns every stored record, values excluded.
 */
abstract listRecords(): Promise<readonly CredentialRecordEntry[]>

/**
 * Serialized read-modify-write over one record — the only write path.
 * `mutate` sees the record as it stands at the moment the write is

 * makes a token refresh safe: two processes rotating one refresh token
 * concurrently would otherwise lose whichever wrote first.
 * @param key - the record to modify.
 * @param mutate - receives the current record and returns its replacement, or `undefined` to leave it.
 * @returns the record after the write, or the current one when `mutate` declined.

Committed change to a stored credential record: a `modifyRecord` that wrote, a `deleteRecord` that removed, or an external edit observed in storage.

Listener failures are contained on the same terms as `credentials/reference-updated`.
