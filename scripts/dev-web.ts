/**
 * Watch-build for the web dev loop: rebuilds every artifact the browser reads
 * from a source edit. Reload signaling is not this script's business — the host
 * webserver stat-polls the bundles it serves and broadcasts `rebuilt` frames
 * itself (`dsh web`), so any process that rewrites `lib/client.js` files
 * triggers reloads; this script is merely the convenient way to keep them all
 * rebuilt on source change.
 *
 * Three stages, because the compile shell links built lib products rather than
 * sources: `tsc -b tsconfig.client.json` emits `lib/types` (the tsdown lib
 * entries are that emit, not `src`), tsdown bundles `lib/index.js` and
 * `lib/client.js`, and `vite build` rewrites `apps/web/dist`, which `dsh web`
 * serves. A missing stage does not fail — it silently shows the previous
 * artifact, so an edit appears to do nothing.
 *
 * MUST NOT run concurrently with `pnpm run build`: both write the same
 * `lib/` and `apps/web/dist/` trees.
 *
 * Usage: `pnpm exec tsx scripts/dev-web.ts [--poll[=ms]]`. Requires one prior
 * `pnpm run build`: every stage is incremental over the previous stage's output
 * and none of them bootstraps a missing tree. `--poll` switches the source
 * watchers to polling (default 500ms): network mounts (weka) deliver no inotify
 * events, so native watching sees the initial build only and never a source
 * change. Polling has to reach tsc too — a native-watching tsc never re-emits
 * `lib/types`, which strands the other two stages on stale input.
 *
 * Each package keeps its own tsdown.config.ts untouched: this script layers
 * `watch` through API-level inline config (tsdown workspace mode fills inline
 * keys under each package's file config, and no package config defines it).
