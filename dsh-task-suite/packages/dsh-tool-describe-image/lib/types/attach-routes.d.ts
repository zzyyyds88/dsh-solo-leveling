/**
 * The /describe-image/attach route: a browser-to-host upload seam that turns a
 * picked image into a durable attachment reference and returns the
 * `[image attachment …]` note text the browser half splices into the composer
 * draft. The note is plain text, so a text-only model sees the reference and
 * can hand the exact JSON to describe_image; the image bytes themselves never
 * cross into the conversation log — they live in the attachment store, exactly
 * like images the vision pipeline uploads.
 *
 * The route works without any plugin configuration (the family aggregate mounts
 * this way): the byte bound falls back to the default and the attachment store
 * is resolved per call, failing with a clear message when it is absent.
