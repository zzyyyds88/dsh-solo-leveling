/**
 * Conversation image preview enhancer. The web shell renders user messages
 * as plain text (no markdown pipeline), so the describe-image reference the
 * send hook splices (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:…)`) sits in the
 * transcript as raw text. This module watches the chat transcript — the
 * official `conversation.session` slot wrapper, which excludes the composer —
 * and upgrades each reference in place into an inline thumbnail (a real
 * button: Enter/Space opens a full-size overlay, focus returns on close).
 * The message text itself is never edited — the original markdown is
 * restored when the toggle turns off or the plugin unloads — so the session
 * log and the model side are untouched.
 *
 * Scanning is scoped and incremental: a lightweight observer on the document
 * only (re)discovers the transcript container, while the content observer on
 * the container processes just the nodes each mutation record carries — no
 * full-page walks during streaming or sidebar churn. If the raw route is
 * unreachable through the current origin (for example a proxy that does not
 * forward it), the thumbnail load fails, the failure is remembered for the
 * session, and the reference text is left alone from there on.
 * @module @zzyyyds88/dsh-tool-describe-image/client/preview
