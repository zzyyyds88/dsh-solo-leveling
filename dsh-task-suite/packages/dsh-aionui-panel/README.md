# dsh-aionui-panel — DSH Web GUI right-panel system

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

> A pixel-faithful re-implementation of AionUi's right-panel system (Apache-2.0 licensed reference implementation, not a copy): Explorer project panel (file tree / filename search / Git changes) + Preview panel (multi-tab preview of 10+ formats) + a unified draggable layout system, with per-project preference persistence.

## Install

Install the family aggregate package `@zzyyyds88/dsh-web-ui-all` (all plugins and skins in one) or this plugin alone:

```sh
# Recommended: install directly from npm
dsh plugin --profile web add @zzyyyds88/dsh-client-ui-aionui-panel

# Or from the repository (development loop)
git clone https://github.com/zhu1090093659/dsh-web-ui.git
cd dsh-web-ui
pnpm install && pnpm -r build
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$(pwd)/packages/dsh-aionui-panel

```

After installing, **restart `dsh web`** and open a project session to see the "预览" (Preview) and "文件/变更" (Files/Changes) panels to the right of the chat area.

## Usage

When a project session (the current session has a working directory) is open, two panels appear to the right of the chat area:

- **Explorer (rightmost column, default 260px, range 220–500px)**: `File / Changes` two tabs; clicking a row in the file tree expands/collapses a folder, clicking a file opens it in the preview panel, and the top filename search (150ms debounce, clicking a result locates it in the tree without interrupting flow); the `Changes` tab reads the real git status and supports stage / unstage / discard (untracked via delete, tracked via restore, bulk discard asks for confirmation).
- **Drag a file to the input box**: file rows in the tree can be dragged (except directory rows); dropping onto the chat input area inserts the relative path (e.g. `deploy/base/deployment.yaml`) at the cursor of the current draft, and the agent reads the file itself once the message arrives — no need to type the path by hand; a highlighted hint bar shows above the input while dragging.
- **Preview (second column from right, default 480px, range 340–1200px)**: multi-tab preview supporting markdown / html / code / diff / csv / pdf / word / excel / ppt / image / text / url; source/preview toggle, split-screen editing (ratio persisted), save (mtime conflict detection), download, refresh (4-state: dead buttons are not rendered), dirty dot, middle-click close, right-click menu batch close (dirty confirm), and tab-overflow gradient indicator.

Interaction details:

- Drag the left edge handle to resize (merged per frame via rAF, body user-select:none); double-click the handle to reset to the default width.
- Two-level width clamping (Explorer first, Preview second) mathematically guarantees the chat area stays >= 360px; out-of-range values are written back to persistence.
- Collapse = width shrinks to 0 while the component stays mounted (tree expanded state / preview tabs are not lost), no transition animation; a floating expand button appears on the right after collapsing.
- Light/dark themes follow the GUI (`body[data-ds-dark-theme]`), and prefers-reduced-motion globally disables animations.
- Preferences persist per project (localStorage keys matching AionUi): `chat-workspace-width-px` / `chat-preview-width-px` / `preview-panel-split-ratio` / `project-panel-collapse:<root>` / `explorer-ui:<root>` / `scm-ui:<root>` / `preview-ui:<root>` (LRU capped at 12 scopes). Reads are always range-checked; invalid values fall back to defaults.

## Data sources

The real filesystem and the real git repository, no mocks:

- The host half (`src/index.ts` + `src/host/`) serves directory listing, file reads (text capped at 80k chars / image data URLs), writes (mtime conflict detection), filename search (skipping .git / node_modules), git status (porcelain v1 -z) / stage / unstage / discard, and an SSE change stream (fs watching + git polling) over the `/aionui-panel/*` HTTP routes.
- All operations pass through a workspace guard: paths must fall inside a registered workspace (realpath normalization + prefix check); the browser can only read/write relative paths under the project root.
- Every `/aionui-panel/*` route (JSON operations, raw reads, and the SSE events stream) is loopback-only: non-loopback clients get `403 forbidden: loopback-only` before any workspace access, matching the dsh-ssh fence.
- The recursive watcher ignores changes under `node_modules` / `.git`; the SCM poll runs every 30s per workspace (each probe bounded by a 15s deadline), and roots that are not git repositories stop being re-probed thanks to a TTL cache. File edits surface via the watcher immediately; `.git`-only changes (commits/checkouts from other tools) appear within one poll interval or on window focus (throttled to once per 5s).
- The browser half (`src/client/`) treats the current session cwd as the project root; switching sessions switches projects.

## Structure

- `src/index.ts` — host half entry (cordis plugin: route registration + systemPrompt announcement).
- `src/host/` — fs/git data services and the route layer (workspace gate).
- `src/core/types.ts` — shared wire types across both halves.
- `src/client/` — browser half: framework-agnostic state core (`store.ts`), drag engine (`drag.ts` + `hooks/useResizableSplit.ts`), DOM layout controller (`layout.ts`, appending panel tracks to the shell's three-column grid), React components (explorer / scm / preview).
- `tests/` — pure-logic tests for the clamp formula, porcelain parsing, persistence validation, markdown/csv rendering, store behavior, etc. (vitest, 37 tests).
