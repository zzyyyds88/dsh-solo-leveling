/**
 * Git-graph surface plugin, browser half: the git branch selector chip,
 * docked above the input card. Preferred seat is the input selector row's
 * context hole (`conversation.input.selector.context`, a session-maybe
 * list slot declared and rendered by newer shipped ui-conversation shells),
 * right beside the official workspace selector; the published npm SDK
 * (rc.6) and the current shipped shell dropped that hole, so the chip waits
 * on its declaration for {@link CONTEXT_FALLBACK_MS} and then falls back to
 * `conversation.input.dock` (the 0.1.9 seat). On the dock, BranchChip
 * indents by the shell's composer side clearance so it starts flush with
 * the input card below it in the active phase; in the hero (blank-session)
 * phase it lifts itself into the official hero chip row, immediately after
 * the agent-preset seat, so the branch chip sits right of the preset name.
 * All git facts arrive through the host /git routes (this package's own host
 * half); the inject face carries the business verbs, the components stay
 * pure props.
 *
 * The context hole is session-maybe: the chip stays mounted from cold start
 * through the active phase and hides itself when its data source is absent
 * (no session cwd, or not a git repository) — no workspace selector lives
 * here, the official selector chip docked above the input card owns that
 * surface. The dock fallback is session-scoped: the chip mounts once a
 * session is active and renders on the dock's own row above the composer
 * card, left-aligned with the input card. Revision 0be6546 moved the chip
 * back to the context hole without a fallback, so on rc.6 shells the inject
 * wait never resolved and the chip disappeared. The published npm SDK (rc.6)
 * dropped the hole's type, so it is spelled locally below.
 * @module dsh-git-graph/client
