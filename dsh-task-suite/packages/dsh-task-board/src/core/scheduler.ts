/**
 * Browser-side scheduler: the heartbeat behind scheduled task runs.
 *
 * The board is a pure client plugin with no server channel, so "定时任务"
 * lives in the tab: a timer ticks every minute (plus immediately on tab
 * visibility recovery) and triggers any task whose `schedule.nextRunAt` is
 * due, rolling the schedule forward to the next cron match before triggering
 * so the same tick never double-fires. Missed runs are skipped, never queued:
 * a task still running at its due instant is skipped by the controller's
 * runTask guard and simply waits for the next cron match.
 *
 * The ticker is controlled: `start` arms a single interval guarded by an
 * idempotence check (a second start while running is a no-op, so wiring can
 * never leak a duplicate timer), and `stop`/`dispose` clear the timer and
 * drop the environment listeners. The board unmount path calls stop/dispose,
 * so no interval or listener outlives the board.
 *
 * Framework-free: all runtime access flows through the injected deps
 * (structural faces), so tests drive ticks directly without timers.
