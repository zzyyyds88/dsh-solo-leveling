/**
 * Sidebar entry injection.
 *
 * dsh's sidebar shell exposes no slot an external plugin can register into
 * (`sidebar.workspaces` / `sidebar.settings` are single-occupant and already
 * taken), so — following the skin precedent of DOM-level extension — the
 * entry row is injected between the shell's New Session button and the
 * workspace browser. The injection self-heals: a MutationObserver watches the
 * sidebar root and re-inserts the row whenever a React re-render displaces it
 * (re-insertion happens in the same frame, before paint, so no flicker).
 *
 * The row is plain DOM (no React tree) so it can never disturb the shell's
 * reconciliation; the board view it toggles is a separate React root mounted
 * in the center column (see board-mount.ts).
