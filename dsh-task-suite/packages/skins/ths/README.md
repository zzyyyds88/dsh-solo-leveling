# @zzyyyds88/dsh-client-ui-skin-ths

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Tonghuashun-style (同花顺) stock-trading skin for the dsh web GUI. It plugs in as a client plugin: `apply()` sets the `data-dsh-ths` body attribute (the whole stylesheet's scope), renders the fixed brand-red title bar with a live-quote chip (上证指数), the quote status bar (上证指数 / 深证成指 / 创业板指, colored 红涨绿跌), a watchlist-style sidebar (red market rule, quote rows) and a terminal-style settings panel, pins the document title and injects the 同 favicon. Its effect disposer retracts every write — the attribute, both bars, the favicon, and the title unless a session title already replaced it. The stylesheet ships inside the bundle via CSS-modules auto-inject, so the loader removes it when the entry is disposed.

The skin is presentation-only: no services are injected, no cordis events are emitted, nothing reaches a model request. The dark palette (`body[data-dsh-ths][data-ds-dark-theme]`) is the night-trading variant, so the base theme system keeps flipping tokens underneath. Scrollbar aliases stay on the base theme, keeping the stock scrollbar contract under the skin.

## Installing (official bundle)

Prefer the family aggregate package `@zzyyyds88/dsh-skins` — every skin at once; for this skin alone, install with `link:`:

```sh
# All skins (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add @zzyyyds88/dsh-skins
# Or just this skin
dsh plugin --profile web add @zzyyyds88/dsh-client-ui-skin-ths
# Activate: dsh-skin use ths
# From the repo (dev): dsh plugin --profile web add link:$(pwd)/packages/skins/ths
```

`$(pwd)` is your clone of the dsh-web-ui monorepo.

A local `link:` install needs built artifacts first — `lib/` is git-ignored and not committed, so run `pnpm install && pnpm -r build` in the monorepo before linking. Git installs (`dsh plugin --profile web add github:<org>/dsh-web-ui#<sha>`) build `lib/` themselves via the `prepare` script; pnpm ≥10 blocks that until you copy the printed package key into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds` list and re-run.

Activate or switch with `dsh-skin use ths` (helper script `scripts/dsh-skin` in the monorepo); only one skin is active at a time.

同一时刻只应激活一个皮肤行——两个皮肤会同时注入窗口 chrome。移除该行（连同包）即可回到默认外观。

## Requirements

The pane-level chrome (sidebar gradient, conversation/details surfaces) keys on the `data-pane` attributes the AppFrame columns carry in `ui-layout`; without them the skin still applies, minus the per-pane surfaces.

## Model Experience

None. The skin mutates only the browser DOM; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known limitations

- The loading page stays stock. The shell's boot page renders before plugin bundles exist, so the skin starts at the settled UI (the boot page still gets the window frame once the attribute is set, but its inner card keeps the modern look).
- Theme switching is skin-internal. The skin pins its own palette under both `data-ds-dark-theme` states; switching Appearance themes flips between the light and dark terminal palettes, not to a non-skin look.
- Quote cells are decorative. The index values in the status bar are static text for the look; they do not track live market data.
