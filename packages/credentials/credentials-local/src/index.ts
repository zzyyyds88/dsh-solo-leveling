/**
 * File-backed credentials provider over `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`, layered
 * against the environment by how much each layer is trusted:
 *
 * ```text
 * inherited process environment      (read-only, wins)
 * > $DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml      (provider-managed, writable)
 * > <invocation cwd>/.env            (read-only fallback)
 * > $DSH_HOME/.env                   (read-only fallback)
 * ```
 *
 * The inherited environment wins because `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=… dsh`, a CI
 * secret, or a container `-e` is this run's explicit intent; it cannot be
 * edited from inside, so it must be *visibly* read-only rather than silently
 * shadow writes. Everything below it loses to the managed store, so a key the
 * Models page writes takes effect immediately even when an older key sits in
 * the user's `.env`.
 *
 * The invoking project may supply a key, because the product trusts the
 * project it is launched in. It ranks below the managed store, so a key stored
 * through the Models page is never displaced by one a checkout happens to carry.
 *
 * The file is the provider-managed writable source: every write re-reads the
 * document under a cross-process writer lock before patching only its own key
 * — comments and the formatting of every untouched entry survive — external
 * edits hot-publish through the seam, and each reload replaces the snapshot
 * wholesale so a deleted entry never lingers in memory.
 *
 * The document holds nothing but credentials, which is why it is a strict
 * `CredentialRef`-to-string mapping rather than a dotenv file: a store the
 * Harness owns and never materializes into the environment cannot also serve
 * as the user's environment layer; a store that doubled as the environment
 * layer would shadow non-secret entries behind its precedence, making them
 * silently unreachable.
