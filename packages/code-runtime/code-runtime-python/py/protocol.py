"""Wire protocol vocabulary for the Python side of dsh-code-runtime-python.

Mirrors ``src/protocol.ts``. Frames travel on fd 3 as JSON-lines (one JSON
object per line). The host validates every inbound frame; this side trusts
host replies.

The wire uses the JSON key ``global`` (a Python keyword), so the frame
``TypedDict``s that carry it are declared with the functional syntax rather than
class bodies: a class attribute cannot be named ``global``, and a ``global_``
attribute would describe a key the wire never sends. Optional-field messages
pair a required base with a ``total=False`` subclass so a required field such as
``type`` cannot be dropped while ``value``/``error``/``truncated`` stay optional.
