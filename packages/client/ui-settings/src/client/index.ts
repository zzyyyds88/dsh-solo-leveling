/**
 * Settings domain base plugin, browser half. Provides `ctx.settingsScope`, the
 * settings-namespace scope service every preference row binds its durable
 * section through, and owns the one `settings.describe` reader in the browser:
 * the describe mirror, whose invalidation subscriptions
 * (`settings/document-updated`, `connection/reset`) live here so every derived
 * surface refreshes from a single wire read. It depends on no `ui-*`
 * presentation package, so any feature that owns a preference can reach it:
 * the settings SHELL — the `sidebar.settings` occupant, its navigation, and
 * the chrome — lives in ui-settings-general, because a shell dependency on
 * ui-sidebar would close a reference cycle through ui-layout and ui-theme.
 * Export discipline: packages/client/AGENTS.md.
