# dsh-tool-describe-image — Image Understanding Tool Plugin

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Model-facing `describe_image` tool: gives **text-only models** (DeepSeek V4 etc.) image understanding.
Each call loads one image — a local file path, an http(s) URL, or a session attachment reference —
and asks an OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint (Qwen-VL, GLM-4V, GPT-4o, a local Ollama endpoint…) to
answer over the Chat Completions or Responses protocol; **only the returned text enters the
conversation, the image itself never enters the session log**.

Ported from deepseek-harness `packages/vision/tool-describe-image` (mirrored at
[whitelonng/dsh-plugin-describe-image](https://github.com/whitelonng/dsh-plugin-describe-image)),
adapted to the dsh-web-ui family conventions: official NPM SDK only, host-side plugin with a
browser half, live settings, no dsh source changes.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Three inputs | Local absolute path, http(s) URL (redirects refused), an `[image attachment …]` JSON note, or the short markdown reference a drag/paste produces (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:…)` — the model passes the id from the URL; the in-process attach registry resolves it and the store's digest verification still runs) |
| Direct image send | Dragging or pasting an image into a text-only session is rewritten at send time into a describe-image reference (`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:…)`) instead of an image block the model cannot read, so the image renders in the conversation and the model analyzes it through the tool |
| Custom instructions | The `prompt` argument carries your precise instruction (OCR, chart reading, UI diagnosis, translation…); the `defaultPrompt` config sets the fallback when the model passes none |
| Live config card | Settings → Plugin config → Web UI Plugins → "Image understanding" card edits `baseURL` / `apiStyle` / `model` / API key / default instruction / bounds (through the settings seam); effective immediately, no restart |
| Protocol styles | `apiStyle: chat-completions` (default) posts to `baseURL/chat/completions`; `apiStyle: responses` posts to `baseURL/responses` with `input` / `max_output_tokens` and reads `output_text` |
| Raw image route | `GET /describe-image/raw/<id>` serves the stored bytes (loopback-only, content-addressed id) so the pasted reference renders in the conversation |
| Per-call key resolution | Inline `apiKey` → credential seam (`apiKeyEnv`, default `VISION_API_KEY`) → launch environment, tiered fallback |
| Safety and bounds | All requests refuse redirects; `maxBytes` / `maxOutputTokens` / `timeoutMs` caps; magic-byte type gate; bounded error excerpts (200 chars); keys never logged |
| Canonical return | `{ text, model, image, mimeType, bytes }` — the model only sees `text` |

## Security model

- Vision requests and image downloads both refuse HTTP redirects (`redirect: 'error'`); bearer credentials
  and image bytes never reach a source other than the configured deployment.
- The request body carries the base64 image but no key; request headers and resolved credentials are not logged.
- Only `http(s)` URLs and local paths are accepted; every other URL scheme is rejected.
- The attach route validates base64, magic bytes, and the byte bound before the attachment store
  persists anything; only the reference JSON (text) crosses into the conversation.
- Response bodies are truncated at the cap (`maxOutputTokens * 8 + 64 KiB`) before parsing.

## Installation

Install the family aggregate `@zzyyyds88/dsh-web-ui-all` (all plugins and skins in one package), or this plugin alone:

```sh
# Recommended: install directly from npm
dsh plugin --profile web add @zzyyyds88/dsh-tool-describe-image
```

The aggregate mounts this plugin **without configuration**: loading is unaffected, and the first call
fails with a clear error (`describe-image: baseURL must be an absolute http(s) URL`) until configured.
Fill in the endpoint and model on the "Image understanding" card under Settings → Plugin config to
start immediately, no restart needed. (Difference from upstream: upstream validates eagerly at load;
the family aggregate has no config entry, so validation is eager only when a composition entry
actually configures it and per-call otherwise.)

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseURL` | — (required) | OpenAI-compatible endpoint root (e.g. `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`); trailing slashes stripped |
| `apiStyle` | `chat-completions` | Protocol style: `chat-completions` appends `/chat/completions`; `responses` appends `/responses` (OpenAI Responses API `input` / `max_output_tokens` / `output_text` shapes) |
| `model` | — (required) | Vision model id |
| `apiKey` | — | Inline key for local debugging; prefer `!!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY` over a hardcoded secret |
| `apiKeyEnv` | `VISION_API_KEY` | Credential reference (environment-variable name); empty string disables reference resolution |
| `defaultPrompt` | see source | The instruction used when a call omits its `prompt` — tune it to your workload (OCR, UI review, translation…) |
| `maxBytes` | `10485760` | Image byte bound (local files and downloads alike) |
| `maxOutputTokens` | `1024` | Output-token cap: `max_tokens` under `chat-completions`, `max_output_tokens` under `responses` |
| `timeoutMs` | `60000` | Per-call vision request timeout |
| `renderImagePreview` | `true` | Upgrade image references in the conversation into inline thumbnails (click for full size); `false` keeps the raw reference text. Display-only — message text and model-side analysis are unchanged |

Configured mount example (profile `cordis.patch.yml` / composition file):

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@zzyyyds88/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
    model: qwen-vl-max
    apiKey: !!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY
```

Endpoints exposing only the Responses API set `apiStyle: responses`:

```yaml
- id: describe-image
  name: '@zzyyyds88/dsh-tool-describe-image'
  config:
    baseURL: https://api.openai.com/v1
    apiStyle: responses
    model: gpt-4o-mini
    apiKey: !!js process.env.VISION_API_KEY
```

## Usage

### Custom instructions

The tool takes a `prompt` argument: tell the vision model exactly what you need — "transcribe all
text", "extract the table as CSV", "diagnose the UI layout problems", "translate the text into
Chinese". A targeted instruction beats a generic description; the tool description steers the
text model toward passing one. Calls without a `prompt` fall back to `defaultPrompt`.

### Sending images directly

Text-only models have no image entry in the DSH input box, so drag or paste an image into the
composer: at send time the plugin rewrites the image-bearing send into a describe-image reference
(`![图片](/describe-image/raw/sha256:…)`) instead of an image block the model cannot read. The
bytes travel to the host `/describe-image/attach` route (validated for size and magic bytes,
persisted in the attachment store); only the reference text enters the session log.
The web shell renders user messages as plain text, so the sent reference would sit in the
transcript as raw markdown; with `renderImagePreview` on (the card's "Render image preview in
chat" toggle, on by default) the client upgrades each reference in place into an inline thumbnail
— click it for a full-size overlay. If the raw route is unreachable through the current origin
(for example behind a proxy that does not forward it), the thumbnail load fails and the reference
text stays as-is.

## Known limitations

- Only the magic-byte gate checks the type; the image is not decoded, so a header-valid but corrupt
  file fails only at the vision endpoint.
- One image per answer: no multi-image input, no follow-up on the previous image, no structured
  output (coordinates / boxes).
- Extracting text still costs one VLM call: OCR-only deployments can point `baseURL` at a cheaper OCR model.
- OpenAI-compatible protocol only: Chat Completions (`/chat/completions`) and Responses (`/responses`)
  are supported; vendors with other request/response shapes need separate adapters.
