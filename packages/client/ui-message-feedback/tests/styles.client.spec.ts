/**
 * Feedback controls stylesheet contract, asserted against the CSS text on disk.
 *
 * A `--dsw-*` name the theme never declares fails silently, and for this sheet
 * it failed loudly in the product: `border`, `background`, and the primary
 * button's fill and label each named a token that does not exist, so every one
 * of those declarations was invalid at computed-value time and dropped. The
 * note editor shipped with no border and no surface, and its Save button with
 * neither fill nor readable label. Nothing downstream reports this — the sheet
 * parses, the classes attach, and the DOM snapshots are unchanged.
 *
 * The editor is a popover portaled to `document.body` and fixed-positioned
 * from the note trigger's rect, so it never enters the IconActions row's flex
 * layout at all — the row keeps its single 28px line of icons and the note
 * trigger, and no wrapping (`flex-wrap`) or `order` is needed for it. The
 * width-independent half of that contract is asserted here (the panel is a
 * fixed portal, not an inline flex item); the resulting geometry is measured
 * in a real engine by `apps/web/tests/message-feedback-layout`.
